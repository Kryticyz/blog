Sometime in the past twenty years developers became convinced that the best websites are necessarily complicated.
I disagree.

The march toward efficiency, interactivity and "scalability" serves the movement toward "web apps". This is not necessarily a bad thing, I love leveraging Onshape as a tool for my 3D modelling needs as part of my 3D printing workflow. Checking my emails, github tickets and Basecamp messages on the web, on whatever computer I can login to, is mighty convenient. Not every application must be a web app, and not every website needs to be an *application*.

I began developing this blog after seeing the rapid pace I was able to output code for a client using Claude Opus 4.5.
In a space of 7 days I was able to assess multiple open source computer vision techniques for my clients purposes. I found one I liked and had the clanker assemble a web interface for non-technical staff to utilise the image processing algorithms I found effective. It was a great success and a pace I am unable to match myself.

Seeing as I had the subscription laying around I spent the next week building web applications: a course planner for my engineering degree at ANU, an album arranger, this blog. I was amazed at the pace of development. Everything I built would get 80% of the way there in 10 minutes! 

I suffered the usual issues, my brain numbed (somewhat assisted by a fair amount of festive drinking), my creativity dwindled, I opted for prompting instead of reading code. Each project stagnated as it hit a barrier I was not yet able to prompt my way out of. So, naturally I let the pendulum swing the other way.

Offended by the complexity of *dependencies*, rejecting the layers of "efficiency" and "scalability" I destroyed my cloudfront cdk, ripped out React and restructured my blog. 

Why should my website be a web app?
Why allow my code to be authored by someone else.
It's not just these words that are my expression. It's not the text, or the layout, or the colours.
It's server, the structure, the commits.
The locations that I write from. The train carraiges birthing ideas.
My code is not written by me. It *is* me.
An immortilisation of my character, a binary representation of the energy that was once me.

Don't get me wrong I love clankers. In time I will bring my own aritificial life into this world, but that droid will be in service of my own expression. It will help me to create, not use me to create. 

So next time you make a "technical" decision, remember that there is more to life than "scalability" or "best practice". There's self expression, creativity, and pride. There's time spent in a codebase, hours spent refining it. There's someone in the future who looks up to you, finding your signature buried deep within an old codebase. Leave them something precious to find. Show the world who you are.
